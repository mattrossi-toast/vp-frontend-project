## Instructions

#### Task 1: Home Page
- Create a bar graph showing a users steps for a week using Chart.js
  - The dependencies have already been taken care of for you, so you only need to generate fake data and generate the chart itself.
  - The colors/styles don't matter
  - **Extra Credit:** Show two values per day - last weeks value and this weeks value
  - Hint: The home page uses the 'AppCtrl' controller

#### Task 2: Leaderboard
- Sort the leaderboard by steps in descending order
- Add rank number and profile image to each user in the leaderboard
- **Extra Credit:** add a search input field that filters the list of members on the leaderboards by the input string

#### Task 3: New Page
- Create a new 'Friends' page
  - Be sure to include it in the navigation
  - Generate 4 cards with random data (pull from an api or create your own data) to represent other members that the user can request to be friends
  - Include a profile image, name, and 'Send Friend Request' button
  - **Extra credit:** Add a separate row for some fake members that the user is already friends with
    - Style them differently
  - **Extra credit 2:** Dynamically change the style of the card and disable the button when 'Send Friend Request' is clicked

#### Extra Credit Task
- Abstract all the api calls to a service module `UsersService`
- Abstract all controllers into their own modules in separate files
